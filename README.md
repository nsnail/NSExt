### Some functional examples

- ##### Git batch management

When you have a clone and a lot of git repositories, use this command to pull their latest code all at once:

```
dot git -a "pull" d:\repos
```

Similarly, you can execute any git commands on a bunch of git repositories in bulk:

```
dot git -a "config --get http.proxy" d:\repos
```

- ##### High-precision time-clock synchronization

Supports parallel requests from multiple NTP clock servers, while removing the network communication duration to set the
precise synchronization of the native clocks with the NTP standard time:

```
dot time -k
```
